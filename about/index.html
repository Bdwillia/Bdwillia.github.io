  <h2 id="hi-im-brett">Hi, I&rsquo;m Brett!</h2>
<p>I am an <strong>embedded software developer</strong> from Edmonton AB, Canada. In
2016 I graduated from the University of Alberta, located here in
Edmonton, with a BSc. in Electrical Engineering.  I have experience
developing embedded software for Oil and Gas technology, specifically
Burner Management Systems for electronic control of industrial
burners.</p>
<p>I am interested in developing a broader and deeper understanding of
the entire hardware and software stack of our computing platforms,
from semiconductor physics, digital circuit design, RTL and VLSI, to
assembly programming, low level systems programming, algorithms, and
beyond. Feel free to check out my <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> page
to see some things I am/have been working on.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am an avid drummer and spend a lot of my free time
practicing, writing music, working on covers, and take a keen interest
in audio engineering for recording and mixing drums.  I&rsquo;m also a
calisthenics enthusiast (strength training through
bodyweight/gymansitcs movements), and I also enjoy strength training
with powerlifting!</p>
<p>Please reach out to me at <strong><a href="mailto:email@address.com">email@address.com</a></strong> if you have any
questions or comments!</p>
