  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Traditionally, audio effects such as filters, reverbs, delays,
distortions, etc., have been implemented using analog circuits. Within
the last 15-20 years digital effects have grown substantially in
viability and popularity due to the increasing ubiquity of low cost,
high performance microprocessors. Digital platforms offer a lot of
benefits over their analog counterparts, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Slimmer form factors</li>
<li>One device fulfilling the role of many effects</li>
<li>Saving and recalling parameter presets</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical drawback of digital processing is the latency experienced
for live use. Depending on the internal signal chain and types of
effects being implemented, latency can be a big issue, especially if
you are chaining multiple digital devices together.</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>For a university capstone design project, I and two other members
designed and implemented a digital guitar effects processor from
scratch. The goal was to create a minimal audio effects processing
platform for guitars with a high quality audio signal chain. The
device consisted of three major stages; the hardware input, the
digital signal processing stage, and the hardware output. This device
was implemented with Eleven Engineering&rsquo;s XInC2 microprocessor, a
multithreaded processor capable of performing finite impulse response
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response"><strong>FIR</strong></a>)
filters with its vector processing unit (VPU). The operation of the
device was controlled through two rotary encoders and user feedback
was provided with two corresponding LED rings and an LCD screen.</p>
<p>I was responsible for the firmware on the microprocessor, which
controlled the digital preamplifier via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface"><strong>SPI</strong></a>,
interfaced with the A/D and D/A stages using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S"><strong>I2S</strong></a>, the user interface
(rotary encoders, LED feedback, and LCD screen), and the audio effects
processing.</p>

<p>The project successfully achieved a low noise floor and minimal
latency from input to output (88 microseconds). Given the limited processing
power of the microprocessor, we only implemented two audio effects, a
&lsquo;bit crusher&rsquo;/&lsquo;downsampler&rsquo; effect, and a hard-gate tremolo effect. We
were unsuccessful in implementing the FIR filters due to configuration
issues with the VPU. Additionally, due to budget and time constraints,
only the input and output hardware stages were realized on PCBs. The
user interface components were implemented on a breadboard, and the
microprocessor on a development board.</p>

<p>The design begins with a passive, direct input stage. This stage must
provide high input impedance, and convert a single-ended (unbalanced)
signal, typical of a guitar input, to differential signal suitable for
the analog-to-digital (ADC) stage. The design was based on a design
provided by Jensen for their <a href="https://www.jensen-transformers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jt-db-e.pdf">JT-DB-E Direct Box Application
Schematic</a>. The
input stage included a variable and switchable attentuation pad with a
high-cut filter switch. An audio transformer was utilized to balance
the input signal and provides a 12:1 step down, suitable to input to a
microphone preamplifier. It also provides Faraday shielding to
minimize noise. The transformer also provides a very high input
impedance, roughly a 10:1 impedance ratio for the output impedance of
a typical wound guitar pickup. The high impedance ratio reduces signal
reflection and guarantee a high quality input signal. Additionally, a
ground lift was implemented, to optionally help eliminate ground loop
hum which may occur in certain situations.</p>
<h4 id="preamplifier">Preamplifier</h4>
<p>A Texas Instruments PGA2505 digitally controlled microphone
preamplifier IC was used to amplify the signal to an appropriate
level, maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in the digital
domain. This also allows a microphone-level XLR connection to be
switched into the circuit. The preamplifier stage is controlled by the
microprocessor via SPI, controlling the gain.</p>
<h4 id="ad-input-buffer">A/D Input Buffer</h4>
<p>A full differential operational amplifier was employed for
conditioning the signal to be suitable for the A/D converter. The
design employed was based on the recommended circuit provided by
Cirrus Logic for the CS5381 A/D converter
(<a href="https://statics.cirrus.com/pubs/proDatasheet/CS5381_F2.pdf">DS563F2</a>). This
circuit provides a DC offset such that signal is suitable for the A/D
0 to 5 V input (centered at 2.5 V). It also limits the peak voltage of
the input signal to 5 V.</p>
<p>The TI OPA1641 op amps were chosen to implement this circuit due to
their high quality and suitability for audio applications with their
high slew rate.</p>
<h4 id="ad-and-da-stages">A/D and D/A Stages</h4>
<p>The Cirrus Logic CS5381 and CS4398 delta-sigma converters were used
for the A/D and D/A stages, respectively. These companion ICs provide
up to 192 kHz sampling rate with 24-bit depth. They communicate with
the microprocessor via I2S serial audio communication. Even though
only a mono input was implemented for our prototype, in the future the
input and/or output hardware stages could be modified for stereo audio
allowing for stereo effects to be employed with these converters.</p>
<p>The CS5381 comes equipped with a built-in digital anti-alias filter,
removing the need for an external anti-aliasing filter on the input.</p>
<h4 id="output-stage">Output Stage</h4>
<p>Following the DAC, the signal is passed through another fully
differential buffer/low-pass filter circuit to a 1:1 output
transformer that converts the signal from differential to
unbalanced. The buffer circuit was modeled after the differential
low-pass filter circuit in Cirrus Logic&rsquo;s
<a href="https://statics.cirrus.com/pubs/proDatasheet/CS5381_F2.pdf">DS568DB1</a>
evaluation board schematic. The output circuit was designed after the
<a href="https://www.jensen-transformers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jt-11p-1.pdf">JT-11P-1</a>
Balanced Line Level to Unbalanced Guitar Level Converter by
Jensen. The output transformer also assists in reducing noise in the
signal by decoupling the output from the rest of the circuit.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>
<p>The user interface consisted of two rotary encoders with LED ring
feedback and an LCD screen. Each encoder interfaced with the
microprocessor via two GPIOs for rotation information, encoding
changes in the position via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code"><strong>Gray
Code</strong></a>, and a third GPIO for
the push button. One of the benefits of rotary encoders is that they
do not have a rotational limit and encode information based on
relative changes instead of an absolute position. This circumvents
issues commonly found with potentiometers in digital applications
where recalling parameter presets can&rsquo;t actually modify the position
of the potentiometers, leading to confusing and unwanted
behaviour. The LED rings were used to display the value of parameters
configured by the user.</p>
<p>The push button of one encoder was used to navigate to the main menu
to select the effect. The push button of the other encoder was used to
give the user control of the gain on the preamplification stage (basic
volume control). When an effect was selected (and the user was not
modifying the input gain) the rotary encoders would allow the user to
control parameters for that effect.</p>
<h3 id="digital-signal-processing">Digital Signal Processing</h3>
<p>The XInC2 microprocessor by Eleven Engineering was used for the
digital signal processing. It provides a digital audio serial
interface (DASI) for communication with the A/D and D/A converters via
I2S. The XInC2 features a hardware multithreaded architecture, i.e.,
does not run on an operating system. This reduces any processing
overhead of context switching threads. This is a 16-bit
microarchitecture, and for the sake of simplicity with prototyping,
only 16-bit samples were used. It also features a vector processing
unit (VPU) which implements a free running multitply and accumulate
unit allowing for hardware accelerated FIR filter processing.</p>
<p>We had separate hardware threads executing for</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading from the DASI input buffer (A/D)</li>
<li>Writing to the DASI output buffer (D/A)</li>
<li>User Interface</li>
<li>Processing Effects</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the effects implemented was a very simple bitcrush and
desampler effect. One parameter controlled the truncation of the input
samples, allowing varying the signal from clean, to something
resembling retro video game consoles. The other parameter controlled
an artifical downsampling of the input, resulting in heavy aliasing
artifacts being introduced and generating some extreme distortion.</p>
<h4 id="hard-gate-tremolo">Hard-gate Tremolo</h4>
<p>Another effect was the &lsquo;Kill Switch&rsquo; effect. The input signal is
simply modulated with a square wave envelope. The two parameters
control the frequency and the duty cycle of the envelope.</p>
