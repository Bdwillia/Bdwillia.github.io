      <description>Introduction In audio processing, Equalization (EQ) is the process of adjusting the relative balance of frequency components in an audio signal. A Parametric EQ is a type of audio equalizer that allows full control over three components of each filter band in the EQ; frequency, gain, and bandwidth. This can be contrasted against other equalizers like graphical equalizers (which you might find in your car stereo for example) that only provides gain control for bands at a fixed frequency interval and have a fixed bandwidth for each band.</description>

      <description>Introduction Vigil is a software-based instrumenting trace profiler, providing users the ability to inspect program execution after it has occurred. This allows for detailed analysis of application performance, and increased visibility into what&amp;rsquo;s occurring in their program. This project is very much a work in progress currently!
Vigil consists of a host application to inspect the execution of a client application, and a portable library (to be utilized by the client application) which interfaces with the host.</description>
