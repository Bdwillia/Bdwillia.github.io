  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Vigil is a software-based instrumenting trace profiler, providing
users the ability to inspect program execution after it has occurred.
This allows for detailed analysis of application performance, and
increased visibility into what&rsquo;s occurring in their program. <strong>This
project is very much a work in progress currently!</strong></p>
<p>Vigil consists of a host application to inspect the execution of a
client application, and a portable library (to be utilized by the
client application) which interfaces with the host. The host
application is written in C++, targetting high-performance desktop
systems. It utilizes the &lsquo;Dear ImGui&rsquo; library for the GUI (with
DirectX11 for Windows), and everything else is written from scratch.
The client library is written mostly in C with a sprinkling of C++ for
some &lsquo;quality of life&rsquo; features. The library is designed as a single
header file to improve ease of integration into projects and source
code management.  It&rsquo;s also designed to be interoperable across a wide
range of platforms, compilers, and CPU architectures and designed to
allow porting to new platforms with minimal effort or having to modify
library internals. It is designed to be tuned by the user for a wide
range of projects, from more constrained bare-metal platforms to high
performance computing environments.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Programmers may think they have a rough idea of how long a given piece
of code will take to execute, but I think in reality most programmers
have almost no idea. Also, if you don&rsquo;t profile your code and profile
it often, it&rsquo;s very difficult to develop an intuition for the expected
performance of a program as you are designing and implementing
it. e.g., what types of constructs are fast or slow given your target
machine, beyond algorithmic complexity types of analysis. Or, being
aware when some system of your program begins exceeding a certain
computational budget.</p>
<p>Another motivating factor is that, in my opinion, &lsquo;printf&rsquo; style
debugging is a superior debugging tool for majority of complicated
bugs, especially when dealing with real-time systems, where line-step
debugging may not always be feasible. This way, the developer is free
to inspect execution <em>after</em> it has occurred. But, the tools we have
as programmers today to facilitate this are extremely limited. At a
relatively low volume of information, rudimentary &lsquo;printf debugging&rsquo;
becomes nearly untenable and takes a huge amount of time to untangle
what actually occurred in the program. It also incurs a large overhead
in developer time just to hone in on the section of code you might
care about. For example, locating an issue via &lsquo;binary searching&rsquo;
source code with printf statements, which involves recompiling and
rerunning your program many times before you can even begin taking a
look at the issue itself. Then at the end, all of your instrumentation
must be deleted, otherwise it may adversely contaminate the console or
logs with indigestible information. Or even worse, given that print
functions can take a long time to execute, they may directly interfere
with the reproducibility of the bug you are trying to track down
(So-called &lsquo;Heisenbugs&rsquo;)!</p>
<p>Vigil attempts to bridge these gaps by providing a low friction tool
with the ability to markup your program (similar to printf style
debugging) and be presented semantic visual information about its
execution after it has occurred. Profiling can be an ongoing
endeavour, working seamlessly in the background. I want a tool that
integrates into my projects with very low friction, and is ready at
the drop of a hat when something unexpected happens to help guide my
understanding of a problem. I also want it to be &lsquo;always on&rsquo; so that I
can make constant corrections in my intuition for how &lsquo;fast&rsquo; a piece
of code is, or that my program is actually doing what I intend.</p>

<p>Trace data is stored to disk, and allows both live viewing of data as
it&rsquo;s being collected, or viewing the data &lsquo;offline&rsquo;, allowing comparisons of
execution across multiple runs of the application. The data is also
located in a single file for convenient storage.</p>
<p>The client library is designed to mitigate performance interference
with the target application. It utilizes thread local trace buffers
for full data partitioning between threads, minimizing contention to
queue data for transmission. Trace data is designed to be directly
serialized to the trace buffers, avoiding any additional data
processing in the client application. It also employs a lock-free
queue for queueing trace data to be serialized across the network, and
lock-free cached memory pool allocators to avoid bulk copies of data
when queueing for transmission. This way, the cost to queue data is
extremely small and effectively passes ownership of memory blocks to
an I/O thread, which will recycle the memory blocks back to the
original thread&rsquo;s possession after transmission. It also allows us to
use an intrusively linked list queue implementation, circumventing
issues related to fixed-size ring buffer queue implementations.</p>
<p>The client library is also designed to facilitate drop-in integration
for projects written on platforms that are already supported (e.g.,
Windows) via a single header file. A minimal amount of work should be
needed to port to new platforms, compilers, and architectures without
having to modify internals of the library. It is currently
interoperable with C99 and C++, and MSVC, GCC, and Clang compilers. As
a proof of concept, I have a from scratch, free-standing/non-hosted,
bare-metal RISC-V (not emulated) FreeRTOS project written in C using
GCC, that incorporates this project, and transmits trace data over
plain UART (and a serial to USB converter). It is also integrated
inside the host application itself, compiling with MSVC and Clang, and
interfaces via TCP. This demonstrates the portability of the library
across CPU architectures, compilers, independence from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">libc</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Standard_Library">libstdc++</a>,
or a hosted system at all, and different types of streaming network
interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>I plan to continue working on this project, and hopefully by making
thorough use of it, I will generate some new and exciting concepts to
implement. Currently it feels a bit limited in its capabilities, but
once I have a more solid technological foundation I plan on iterating
heavily on the usability aspect, and turning it into a much more
powerful tool.</p>
<h4 id="backend-technologynetworking">Backend Technology/Networking</h4>

<p>Add shared memory Interprocess Communication (IPC) for applications
running on the same machine.</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="user-facing-features">User-facing Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Source code view in host application, allowing one to directly view

of requiring user to interpret and translate the source location
manually. Or perhaps a command interface to allow communication
with text editors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally allow users to store a source code tree in a given trace
session file, thereby versioning the data with the exact source
code it came from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow user to filter heuristics by a selected region in the
timeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add more detailed information to heuristics, and add additional
statistical graphs etc for presentation.</p>

<li>
<p>Support for tracing multiple client applications concurrently
(e.g., tracing networked client machines that are interfacing with
one another.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for viewing multiple sessions simultaneously, allowing
users to inspect and contrast multiple runs of the program (e.g.,
comparing performance of a code change) without having to close and
reopen each session over and over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow tight integration of multiple sessions together to help
facilitate these comparisons, correlate different runs, etc.</p>
</li>
