  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In audio processing, Equalization (EQ) is the process of adjusting the
relative balance of frequency components in an audio signal. A
Parametric EQ is a type of audio equalizer that allows full control
over three components of each filter band in the EQ; frequency, gain,
and bandwidth. This can be contrasted against other equalizers like
graphical equalizers (which you might find in your car stereo for
example) that only provides gain control for bands at a fixed
frequency interval and have a fixed bandwidth for each band. This
makes Parametric EQs a very versatile audio processing tool in the
studio, from broad stroke frequency adjustments like boosting the bass
and treble of the master bus for a more exciting mix, or surgically
cutting harsh resonant frequencies often found in drum cymbals.</p>
<p>I created a digital Parametric EQ audio plugin for digital audio
workstations (DAWs) targetting Steinberg&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies/vst3.html">Virtual Studio
Technology</a>
(VST3) plugin format. This project utilizes <a href="https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol">Oli Larkin&rsquo;s
edition</a> of the Cockos' IPlug
audio plugin framework and <a href="https://cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> 2D
graphics library. This EQ implements Robert Bristow-Johnson&rsquo;s (RBJ)
<a href="https://music.columbia.edu/pipermail/music-dsp/2001-March/041752.html">biquad
filters</a>,
providing a selection of low cut, high cut, low shelf, high shelf, and
peaking EQ filters, and also allows for an unlimited number of filter
bands.</p>

<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<p>In this plugin, the user has the ability to implement any number of
digital filters they want to form the overall EQ. Each band has three
main controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>frequency</strong> of the band, which may mean the center frequency or
the corner frequency (-3 dB) depending on the filter type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>gain</strong> of the band, which when applicable (depending on
filter type) will control how much that band is adding or
subtracting for its bandwidth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor"><strong>&lsquo;Q&rsquo;</strong></a> of the band
is a sort of coarse control for bandwidth. This can control how
wide or narrow the frequency bandwidth is for the peaking filter,
or emphasize resonant bumps seen in the high/low pass and shelving
filters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bands can be added via ctrl + left clicking, their controls can be
accessed by clicking the colored circle that&rsquo;s a part of their band,
and can be deleted by pressing the red &lsquo;x&rsquo; in the corner of their
controls. The mouse can be used to drag the band around (controlling
the <strong>&lsquo;freq&rsquo;</strong> by moving along the x-axis, and controlling the
<strong>&lsquo;gain&rsquo;</strong> by moving along the y-axis). The mouse wheel controls the
<strong>&lsquo;Q&rsquo;</strong> of the band. All of these parameters can also be accessed by
the knobs at the bottom of the screen. Additionally, double clicking
on a band will disable it (which can be seen by it becoming grayed
out), and won&rsquo;t contribute to the processing of the EQ.</p>
<h2 id="audio-processing">Audio Processing</h2>
<p>The RBJ Biquads are a general 2nd order infinite impulse response
(IIR) digital filter. They are implemented in code with the following
Direct-Form 1 difference equation:</p>
<figure>
  
  <a href="/images/parametriceq/rbj_direct_form_1.png">
    <img src="/images/parametriceq/rbj_direct_form_1.png"
         alt="Direct Form 1"/>
  </a><figcaption>
    <a href="/images/parametriceq/rbj_direct_form_1.png">Direct Form 1</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>IIR filters are characterized by their feedback path (as seen by the
<strong>y[n-1]</strong> and <strong>y[n-2]</strong> terms) where their impulse response never
decays to zero. Their computational complexity is (in general)
significantly lower than their FIR counterparts, requiring fewer
computations per time step and less memory.</p>
<p>The various filter coefficients can be computed depending on the
desired type of filter one wants to implement. More detail on how
these coefficients are computed can be found in RBJs original post
<a href="https://music.columbia.edu/pipermail/music-dsp/2001-March/041752.html"><strong>here</strong></a>,
where he outlines designs for the high/low pass, high/low shelf, and
peaking filter designs utilized in this project.</p>
<p>Additionally, this plugin computes the amplitude response of the EQ,
allowing the user to interact with a visual representation of the
filters that they have configured.</p>
<h2 id="equalizer-amplitude-response">Equalizer Amplitude Response</h2>
<p>The graphical gain vs. frequency plot that the user sees and interacts
with is produced by computing the amplitude response (or <em>magnitude
frequency response</em>) portion of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot">Bode
Plot</a> for the cascaded filter
bands configured by the user. The amplitude response provides the
frequency-gain that the filter applies to an arbitrary input signal as
a function of frequency. See below for a diagram of the cascaded
filter stages of the equalizer, where <strong>x[n]</strong> is our time-domain
input signal, <strong>y[n]</strong> is the time-domain output signal, and <strong>h[n]</strong>
is the overall time-domain transfer function of the system, made up of
serially cascaded filter bands each with their own transfer functions.</p>
<figure>

  </a><figcaption>
    <a href="/images/parametriceq/cascaded_system_overview.png">System Overview</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here I will go into some details about how we
can compute and display the amplitude response for this system.</p>
<h4 id="frequency-response">Frequency Response</h4>
<p>First, we will look at computing the frequency response for an
arbitrary system, and how the amplitude response relates to it. Then
we can apply it to our biquad filters.</p>
<p>A discrete time-domain transfer function <strong>h[n]</strong> is related to its
frequency domain representation <strong>H(z)</strong> through the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform"><strong>z-transform</strong></a>. A
discrete linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by the
transfer function <strong>H(z)</strong> has a frequency response given by the
following (in polar form):</p>
<figure>
  
  <a href="/images/parametriceq/freq_response_def.png">
    <img src="/images/parametriceq/freq_response_def.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

<p>The amplitude response is given by <strong>|H(Ï‰)|</strong>. Given the
complex-valued transfer function, this can be computed as follows:</p>
<figure>
  
  <a href="/images/parametriceq/amplitude_response_def.png">
    <img src="/images/parametriceq/amplitude_response_def.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

<p>Next, we need to compute the overall amplitude response of our
system. Our system is made up of multiple filters cascaded
together. Since each one is an LTI system, it is very easy to combine
them into a manageable result when working in the frequency
domain. Multiple cascaded LTI systems are characterized by the
convolution of their discrete-time transfer functions, and
consequently the multiplication of their frequency domain transfer
functions:</p>
<figure>
  
  <a href="/images/parametriceq/cascaded_freq_response.png">
    <img src="/images/parametriceq/cascaded_freq_response.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

<p>Thus, to compute the amplitude response of the cascaded system, we can
compute the amplitude response of the individual transfer functions
multiplied together. Finally, we need to convert the gain described as
a scaling factor into a gain in decibels (dB). This also results in a
nice little simplification that makes computing the overall amplitude
response a bit easier, by only needing to add the gains (in dB)
instead of multiplying the complex-valued results together.</p>
<figure>
  
  <a href="/images/parametriceq/cascaded_amplitude_response_gain.png">
    <img src="/images/parametriceq/cascaded_amplitude_response_gain.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

<h4 id="response-of-biquad-filters">Response of Biquad Filters</h4>
<p>The discrete transfer function for each RBJ biquad filter band is
provided as follows</p>
<figure>
  
  <a href="/images/parametriceq/rbj_transfer_function.png">
    <img src="/images/parametriceq/rbj_transfer_function.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

<p>Now, we can determine the frequency response of the biquad. We will
use Euler&rsquo;s formula to expand the complex exponentials into their
sinusoidal components, and a couple trig identities for
simplification.</p>
<figure>
  
  <a href="/images/parametriceq/rbj_biquad_freq_response_1.png">
    <img src="/images/parametriceq/rbj_biquad_freq_response_1.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

<p>Next, we can combine our real and imaginary components to get the
numerator and denominator into standard form.</p>
<figure>
  
  <a href="/images/parametriceq/rbj_biquad_freq_response_2.png">
    <img src="/images/parametriceq/rbj_biquad_freq_response_2.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

<p>Now, we are in a little bit of a pickle. We need to get this entire
expression into standard form so we can use it to compute the
amplitude response, but the division of two complex numbers makes this
a bit tricky. We can multiply and divide by the complex conjugate of
the denominator to get the denominator into a purely real quantity.</p>
<figure>
  
  <a href="/images/parametriceq/rbj_biquad_freq_response_3.png">
    <img src="/images/parametriceq/rbj_biquad_freq_response_3.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

<p>This is great! Now that we have this in standard form, we can use our
previous formulas for computing the gain. Then, we need to make a
substitution for <strong>Ï‰</strong> to convert from angular frequency to discrete
ordinary frequency <strong>f</strong>.</p>
<figure>
  
  <a href="/images/parametriceq/rbj_biquad_freq_response_4.png">
    <img src="/images/parametriceq/rbj_biquad_freq_response_4.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

<h4 id="plotting-the-amplitude-response">Plotting the Amplitude Response</h4>
<p>For this EQ, we want to plot both the amplitude response of each
individual filter, as well as the response of the whole system. We can
do this by testing the filters at varying frequency bins (representing
our x-axis) to compute the gain for each filter at each bin, then
combine them to compute the overall response of the EQ. Then we can
plot the gains as a function of frequency to create a visualization of
each filter band as well as the complete response. We want to display
our x-axis as a logarithmic scale, so we need to convert our
x-coordinates to a frequency on a logarithmic scale instead of a
linear scale. For the sake of simplicity, in the pseudo code example
below we will create a frequency bin for each pixel on the x-axis, and
we will also avoid interpolating from bin to bin.</p>

<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>In the future, I would like to add a phase plot for fun. This isn&rsquo;t
something I&rsquo;ve seen on digital EQs before, and it could be very
handy. If you aren&rsquo;t listening carefully or don&rsquo;t understand the
phenomena, filters (depending on the design) can introduce
frequency-dependent phase shifts, which can create phase cancellation
between multiple sources that is very difficult to diagnose. This
will be most commonly encountered when trying to do processing on
different sources with lots of low frequency information (e.g., kick
drum and bass guitar) which causes phase cancellation, reducing their
impact.</p>
<p>I would also like to try incorporating a live spectrum analyzer, so
you can see the frequency content of an input source and visualize the
effect EQ changes are having on the output. This would also give me an
excuse to try my hand at writing an FFT butterfly from scratch.</p>
